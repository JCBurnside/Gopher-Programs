Gophers-Programs
================

**Contents**

**GML** 

A gui library, with example programs. In development, fully usable but with only a few gui components implemented so far, already fully capable of doing dialog boxes and basic forms.

See the wiki for documentation, or just head to the /bin directory to look at some sample programs.

**Contributions**

If you want to modify this code, feel free! If you're thinking of sending me pull requests of your modifications... I won't say /don't/, but being a control freak, unless it something we've talked about first and I've agreed to, I'm likely to be annoyed at you, and the fact that I have no sound logical grounds to be annoyed will make me more annoyed, and then you probably won't get a christmas card from me, which will be horribly cruel and completely unfair.
